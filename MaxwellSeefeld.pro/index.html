                    <p>
                        Endpoint detection and response (EDR) is a security service that helps companies detect and respond to security threats on their computer networks. EDR services use a variety of techniques to detect threats, including network traffic analysis, host-based intrusion detection, and malware analysis. Once a threat is detected, EDR services can help companies respond to the threat by providing information about the threat and its potential impact on the company's network.z
